# **Project Summary -** ### **Summary of the Amazon Prime EDA Project**

In this project, I have analyzed a dataset from Amazon Prime that contains two tables: `credits.csv` and `title.csv`. The goal was to explore and understand the data to uncover interesting patterns and insights.

1. **Credits Table**:
   - This table contains information about the cast and crew of Amazon Prime titles, including their `person_id`, `name`, `character`, and `role` .
   - I analyzed the distribution of roles (actors vs. directors), identified the most frequent actors and characters, and checked how many people are associated with each title.

2. **Titles Table**:
   - This table contains details about Amazon Prime titles, such as `title`, `type` (movie or show), `release_year`, `genres`, `runtime`, and ratings from IMDB and TMDB.
   - I explored the content distribution TV show vs movie, analyzed the release years that witnessed highest number of releases, and identified the most popular genres. I have checked the correlation between the IMDB and TMDB score.

3. **Merged Data**:
   - I combined the two tables titles and credits for an effective data analysis.

4. **Key Insights**:
   - I found the most popular genres, the distribution of content types (movies vs. shows), and the top actors and directors.
   - We also observed trends in release years and checked the presence of outliers in the IMDB scores.

This EDA helps us understand the Amazon Prime dataset better and provides a foundation for further analysis, such as building recommendation systems or predicting the success of titles.
